# Performance Optimization Notes

## Already Optimized:
✅ Lazy loading apps with React.lazy + Suspense
✅ AnimatePresence for smooth mount/unmount
✅ CSS variables for instant theme switching
✅ Framer Motion using GPU-accelerated transforms
✅ Glass effects with will-change hints

## Current Performance:
- All animations use transform/opacity (GPU accelerated)
- Components lazy load on demand
- Theme switching is instant (CSS variables)
- Window dragging is smooth (no layout thrashing)

## To Test:
1. Open Chrome DevTools → Performance tab
2. Record while opening/closing windows
3. Check for 60fps in timeline
4. Monitor memory usage

## Next Steps if needed:
- Add React.memo to Window component
- useMemo for sorted window lists
- useCallback for event handlers
- Image optimization for wallpapers (when added)
